# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game-Using-OpenCV
This project is an interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors game built with Python, OpenCV, and CVZone.   The player shows hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) to the webcam, and the AI generates its own move.   The game keeps track of scores in real time with a dynamic background interface.
